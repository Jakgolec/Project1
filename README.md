## Testing 

- After viewing website on github pages, I saw that letter were not standing out and changed them to white to increase accessibility.
- Viewing About Us section made me realize text was too small and required to match introduction in size.
- Used different browsers like Mozilla and chrome to test the website
- I utilized Chrome developer tools to see how will the website display on different devices.
